This project is a playground of sorts for various ideas and technologies I am curious about implementing in a web application. Often times I will find myself working through a tutorial while learning some new tech and find myself curious about how I would integrate it into a larger project. One of the points of developing the **Local Library** application is to have that larger project into which I can attempt to insert various technologies and application workflows I am curious about.
