# Manzer Notes

Dendron root node for note vautls. The notes below will attempt to follow general project stucture but I suffer the same vicissitudes as many other creative invdividuals who have more ideas than they have space or time to place them in. Things get lost, stuff goes out of order. Eventually it'll drive me nuts enough to fix it but depending on when someone happens across this little adventure it note taking this may appear rather disorderly.

## Projects

- [[Local Library|localibrary]] - A simple but complete full-stack web application replicating a local library site for patrons. It uses Django & DRF for the back-end and Nuxt.js for the front-end.
- [[NDBC Reader|ndbc-reader]] - A [[Python package|https://pypi.org/project/NDBC/]] designed to simplify the process of accessing and analyzing data from National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) data stations.  This was inspired by the code I wrote during my M.Sc. thesis project.
