This project is a playground of sorts for various ideas and technologies I am curious about implementing in a web application. Often times I will find myself working through a tutorial while learning some new tech and find myself curious about how I would integrate it into a larger project. One of the points of developing the **Local Library** application is to have that larger project into which I can attempt to insert various technologies and application workflows I am curious about. The application built here is based upon the excellent [Django tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django) created by the bright folks at Mozilla Developer Network. This tutorial took me from a general, if basic, understanding of implementing Django to a level of mastery that made me confident I could build production software tools with it. It's become a core part of my goto toolkit when building database powered applcations.
